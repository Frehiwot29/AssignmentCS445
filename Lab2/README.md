### Write a paper comparing the similarities and differences between SpiderMonkey and V8

## V8

- Google’s high-performance open source JavaScript and WebAssembly engine. Our mission: enable developers to build a faster future web.
  - interpreter in V8 is called Ignition
  - While it runs the bytecode, it collects profiling data, which can be used to speed up the execution later
  - When a function becomes hot, for example when it’s run often, the generated bytecode and the profiling data are passed on to TurboFan
  - our optimizing compiler, to generate highly-optimized machine code based on the profiling data.

## SpiderMonkey

- Mozilla’s JavaScript engine as used in Firefox and in SpiderMonkey SpiderNode, does it a little differently
  - They have not one but two optimizing compilers.
    \*They have not one but two optimizing compilers. The interpreter optimizes into the Baseline compiler, which produces somewhat optimized code. Combined with profiling data gathered while running the code, the IonMonkey compiler can produce heavily-optimized code. If the speculative optimization fails, IonMonkey falls back to the Baseline code.
